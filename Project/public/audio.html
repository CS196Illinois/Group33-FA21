          /* We want to be able to fetch all of the audio from Firebase and display it 
              using the fetch script, iterating through every element.
          * For this, we either need to:
            - have a seperate file on Firebase that contains the generated ID of every single audio file (which isn't ideal) 
            or
            - Find a script that would return the name of every JSON file (ID).
          * Another thing to consider:
            - We don't want to have to get EVERY single audio file at once, 
              so we need to have a selection / filtering system.
            - This could be:
              - Start with a button at the bottom of the page, that when clicked, loads another X things.
              - Then make *filtering* by:
                - Location
                - Date
                - Length
                - Tags (assigned using the AI / ML Component)
                - etc.
