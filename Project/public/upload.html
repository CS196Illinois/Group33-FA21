    /* writing these notes in a script tag cuz I'm lazy, and I really don't wanna code this rn

    We need a few frontend elements on this page for the user to enter:
      - File Upload Element
      - Map to select location
      - Title of Sound:
      - Description of Sound:
      - Idk, name of uploader?
        - NOTE: User authentication is a thing that we can try to implement later
    TODO:
      - Find a way to upload an audio file through an API
      - Create the basic DOM elements
      - Implement an express POST function that uploads the AUDIO and JSON data to the server

    Idea for how to approach this:
      - Start by making the HTML form upload page
      - Send the info to an endpoint / method that will:
        - Create a unique key
        - Construct a JSON file from the form information provided
          - If any required information is missing, this should should be handled.
          - Stop the process and force the user to enter the correct information.
        - Upload the JSON file (named using the key) to Firebase
        - Upload the Audio file (named using the key) to Firebase
